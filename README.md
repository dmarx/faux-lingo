# FauxLingo

FauxLingo is a toolkit for generating synthetic language data using a constructed language framework. It simulates low-entropy, structured corpora via a graph-based topic model with color-coded (i.e. grammar-inspired) transitions, preferential attachment, and hierarchical vocabulary construction.

## Features

- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Create corpora with controlled entropy and structure.
- **Graph-Based Topic Modeling**: Model grammatical constraints using a color transition matrix.
- **On-the-Fly Data Streaming**: Integrate seamlessly with PyTorch's DataLoader for training language models.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Control vocabulary size, topic concentration, attachment biases, and more.

## Installation

You can install FauxLingo via pip (when released on PyPI):

```bash
pip install faux_lingo
```

Or clone this repository and install locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/faux_lingo.git
cd faux_lingo
pip install .
```

## Usage Example

Here's a quick example of how to use FauxLingo with a PyTorch DataLoader:

```python
from faux_lingo.dataset import GenerativeCorpusDataset
from faux_lingo.data_generator import generate_artifacts
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

# Generate fixed artifacts for the synthetic corpus.
artifacts = generate_artifacts(
    num_topics=5,
    word_vocab_size=100,
    characters_per_word=3,
    runes_per_character=3,
    tokens_per_rune=1,
    token_vocab_size=10,
    rune_vocab_size=30,
    char_vocab_size=20,
    topic_word_alpha=0.1,
    num_colors=5,
    avg_degree=5,
    modes_per_color=2,
    attachment_bias=0.5,
    random_color_transition=False,  # uniform color transitions by default
    color_transition_matrix=None,     # user-supplied matrix takes priority if provided
    sigma=1.0,
    epsilon=0.1,
    seed=42
)

# Create the dataset and DataLoader.
dataset = GenerativeCorpusDataset(doc_count=1000, doc_length=50, artifacts=artifacts, doc_topic_alpha=0.5)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=16, shuffle=True)

# Iterate over a batch.
for batch in dataloader:
    print(batch.shape)  # e.g., (16, sequence_length)
    break
```

### Package Code Files

Within the `faux_lingo/` package folder you’d include your implementation files. For example:

- **`faux_lingo/__init__.py`**  
  (Usually empty or with package-level docstrings.)

- **`faux_lingo/data_generator.py`**  
  Contains functions like `generate_token_vocab`, `generate_artifacts`, and all graph-based generators.

- **`faux_lingo/dataset.py`**  
  Contains the `GenerativeCorpusDataset` class and the `generate_document` function.

- **`faux_lingo/models.py`**  
  (Optional) Could contain example model definitions (e.g., a simple LSTM for language modeling).

- **`faux_lingo/utils.py`**  
  (Optional) Helper functions and additional utilities.

- **`tests/test_data_generator.py`**  
  Contains tests for your data generation routines (e.g., checking that generated corpora have the expected structure).

---

This structure and these files form a strong starting point for packaging FauxLingo on PyPI. You can add additional modules, tests, and documentation as your project grows.
